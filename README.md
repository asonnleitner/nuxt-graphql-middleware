# Nuxt GraphQL Middleware

Keep your GraphQL server private: Expose GraphQL queries and mutations as fully
typed API routes.

**[Documentation](https://nuxt-graphql-middleware.dulnan.net)** –
**[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nuxt-graphql-middleware)** –
**[Version 2.x (for Nuxt 2)](https://github.com/dulnan/nuxt-graphql-middleware/tree/2.x)**

[![Test](https://github.com/dulnan/nuxt-graphql-middleware/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/dulnan/nuxt-graphql-middleware/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)

## Features

- Exposes each query and mutation as an API route
- GraphQL requests are only done on the server side
- No GraphQL documents in client bundle
- Includes composables to perform queries or mutations
- Modify request headers, responses and handle errors
- HMR for all GraphQL files
- Integration with [Nuxt DevTools](https://devtools.nuxtjs.org)
- Full TypeScript integration for schema, queries, mutations and fragments using
  [graphql-code-generator](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator)

# Setup

## Install

```bash
npx nuxi@latest module add nuxt-graphql-middleware
```

Minimal configuration needed:

```javascript
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['nuxt-graphql-middleware'],
  graphqlMiddleware: {
    graphqlEndpoint: 'https://example.com/graphql',
  },
})
```

## Usage

Write your first query, e.g. in pages/films.query.graphql:

```graphql
query films {
  allFilms {
    films {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

Your query is now available via the useGraphqlQuery() composable:

```typescript
const { data } = await useGraphqlQuery('films')
console.log(data.allFilms.films)
```

Or using the convenience wrapper for useAsyncData:

```typescript
const { data } = await useAsyncGraphqlQuery('films')
console.log(data.value.allFilms.films)
```

Alternatively you can also call
`http://localhost:3000/api/graphql_middleware/query/films` to get the same
result.

The 3.x releases are only compatible with Nuxt 3. The
[2.x branch](https://github.com/dulnan/nuxt-graphql-middleware/tree/2.x) and
